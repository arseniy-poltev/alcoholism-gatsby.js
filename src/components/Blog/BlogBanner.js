                If you have a drug or alcohol addiction, you need treatment to
                recover. Treatments range from intensive inpatient therapy to
                outpatient counseling. Numerous therapies are effective for
                different types of drug addiction. Recovery isnâ€™t easy, but the
                path to sobriety begins by seeking treatment.
